Hi, my name is Ify, and this is the beginning of my programming journey.
THe current project is testing our ability to create a repository on github and commit it when we are done editing the file. 
At the end of this project, I hope to understand github and repositories and git and knowing how git operates because it is honestly quite confusing to me right now.
